## Changes in this fork

Frontend-only tweaks aimed at operating REAPER hands-on from a vocal booth. The Zig
extension/backend is untouched — rebuild with `make frontend` and reload REAPER.

- **Timeline ruler = tap-to-seek.** Tap anywhere on the ruler to move the playhead there.
  The playhead handle is now a display-only indicator (no more fiddly drag-to-grab).
- **Free-hand loop / time selection.** Drag a finger across the track region to set the
  time selection directly. Grid/boundary snapping is removed — selections are free-hand.
  (Trade-off: drag-to-pan in the track area is disabled; use pinch to zoom/pan.)
- **Long-press → FX view.** Press and hold a track — either its **lane in the timeline**
  or its **name in the mixer** — to open that track's FX chain (bypass, presets, per-plugin
  parameter editing, add FX). No more digging through nested menus. Backed by a small global
  `fxView` store slice + `FxViewHost`, so the FX view can be summoned from anywhere.

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release from [Releases](../../releases)
2. **Run** `Install_REAmo.lua` in REAPER (Actions > Run ReaScript)
3. **Restart REAPER**
4. **Extensions > REAmo > Show QR Code** — scan it with your phone
5. **Add to Home Screen** for a native app feel

That's it.

## Installation

### Automatic (Recommended)

1. **Download** the latest `REAmo-vX.X.zip` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. **Extract** the ZIP file
3. In REAPER, run **Actions > ReaScript: Run ReaScript...** (Action ID: 41060)
4. Select `Install_REAmo.lua` from the extracted folder
5. **Restart REAPER**
6. *(Optional)* **Preferences > Media** — uncheck **Set media items offline when application is not active**. If enabled, REAPER takes media offline when you switch to another app, which prevents waveforms from loading on your device.

### Uninstall

Run `Uninstall_REAmo.lua` using the same Run ReaScript action.
